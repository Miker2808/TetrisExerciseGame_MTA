TODOs:
- Fixing the issue where the bomb is causing the walls to be removed after an explosion
- Heuristics may need additional parameter (roughness is probably needed)
  (Will require a specialized function to calculate roughness at a certain column, then another method for the whole board)
- The bombs functions need a revision, one function inside the TetrisGame is double for loops, and inside another functions from Tetromino required another double for loops
  A rewrite that is less complicated may be needed, more functions may be added as needed.
- Amir stated that free floating blocks may need to fall after an explosion, may require an elaboration.
